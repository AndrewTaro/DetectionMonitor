# Detection Monitor
This mod indicates the detected players.

AutoSpy, who no longer plays World of Warships, developed the original concept of this mod.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive, and you should get `gui`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/gui`, etc.
4. Done!
